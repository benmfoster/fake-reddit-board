# Fake Reddit Board

Fake Reddit Board, which I created with React.js, is an exclusive, one-page take on Fake Reddit, residing within Fake Reddit's social architecture. Think authoritarian /b. https://github.com/benmfoster/fake-reddit-board

# Fake Reddit

On Fake Reddit, a user can create her own profile, publish posts, and "downvote" other users' posts. Every post she publishes gives her the opportunity to upload an accompanying image, and she can also upload a unique image that will show up on her profile, her posts, and any comments she publishes. To get the conversation going, she can comment on the posts of other users and tag other users in her comments. If another user comments on one of her posts or tags her in a comment, she will receive a notification on her homepage. I made the website's backend using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and the frontend is built on the Vue.js framework. CSS was implemented using Bootstrap.

In July 2019, I presented my capstone project Fake Reddit to a group of panelists including the CEO of Actualize, Jay Wengrow, as well as outside software engineers. I had a polite but heated exchange with Robert Rosenberg of Off Base Productions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
